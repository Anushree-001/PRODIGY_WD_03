# PRODIGY_WD_03
Welcome to Tic Tac Toe application, also known as Noughts and crosses! The goal of this project was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe board which is able to monitor the state of a game and return the win/loose/draw state of the game after each player's move. The game allows two players to play against each other.
